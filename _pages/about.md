Welcome to my homepage.I am a student in the second year of my master's degree, currently studying in Beijing University of Technology, School of Information Science and Technology.My major is electronic information. The directions I am more interested in are Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, Continul Learning, Few-shot Learning and Few-Shot Incremental Learners.
My first work on continuous learning is in preparation.
