Welcome to My Digital Atelier! 🎓✨

Greetings! I am currently navigating the exhilarating waters of my second year as a Master's student at the Beijing University of Technology, nestled within the School of Information Science and Technology. My academic compass is set towards the vast and dynamic field of Electronic Information, with a particular fascination for the realms of Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, Continual Learning, Few-shot Learning, and Few-Shot Incremental Learners. 🧠💡

In the grand tapestry of my academic journey, I am meticulously weaving my first scholarly contribution on Continual Learning, which is currently in the meticulous stages of preparation. Stay tuned for what promises to be a riveting addition to the academic discourse! 📚🔬

Feel free to explore my digital domain, where the pursuit of knowledge meets the joy of discovery. Let's embark on this intellectual adventure together! 🚀🌌
